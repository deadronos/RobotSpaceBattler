# Active Context â€” RobotSpaceBattler

## Current focus

- Build a unified weapons ECS (guns, lasers, rockets) on top of miniplex.
- Maintain deterministic simulation utilities.

## Recent changes

- Added seeded RNG helper and tests.
- Drafted weapons ECS design doc and system skeletons.

## Next steps

- Integrate weapon systems into `Simulation`.
- Expand unit tests for cooldowns and projectile lifecycle.
- Add more tasks to `memory-bank-/tasks/_index.md` as work items are discovered.

## Decisions

- Rapier's RigidBody is authoritative for transforms; ECS components should read from Rapier each frame.
