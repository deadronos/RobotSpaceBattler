# Handover Report — RobotSpaceBattler

Date: 2025-09-17

This file summarizes what from the three implementation plans and the original handover has been completed, partially implemented, or not implemented in the repository. It is concise and references the implementation evidence (files) to make follow-up work straightforward.

## Summary (high level)

- Done: core simulation loop, physics integration, basic robot prefabs, weapon systems (hitscan, projectile, beam), damage & death handling, basic AI and perception, seeded RNG, Playwright smoke test file.
- Partial: AI tuning/state expansions, deterministic harness beyond RNG (some unit tests exist), markdown cleanup for this handover file.
- Not done: glTF asset loader & asset store, Respawn system, Scoring system + ScoreBoard UI, centralized feature-flagging, projectile pooling and performance harness, CI workflow to run Playwright tests automatically.

## Evidence / File references

- Physics & scene: `src/components/Scene.tsx` (Canvas + `<Physics/>` wrapper)
- Procedural robot prefab: `src/robots/robotPrefab.tsx`, `src/robots/prefabCatalog.ts`
- ECS store: `src/ecs/miniplexStore.ts`
- Weapons: `src/systems/WeaponSystem.ts`, `src/systems/HitscanSystem.ts`, `src/systems/ProjectileSystem.ts`, `src/components/Beam.tsx`
- Damage & death: `src/systems/DamageSystem.ts`
- AI & perception: `src/systems/AISystem.ts`, `src/systems/perception.ts`
- Seeded RNG & determinism helpers: `src/utils/seededRng.ts` and tests in `tests/` (e.g., `seededRng.test.ts`)
- Playwright smoke test (exists but not wired into CI): `playwright/tests/smoke.spec.ts`

Missing or not present (search confirmed no matching files): `src/assets/loader.ts`, `src/assets/assetStore.ts`, `src/systems/RespawnSystem.ts`, `src/systems/ScoringSystem.ts`, `src/components/ui/ScoreBoard.tsx`, `src/hooks/useFeature.ts` (or similar centralized feature flag), and any GitHub Actions workflow that runs the Playwright smoke test.

## Requirements coverage mapping

- Simulation & rendering: Covered by `Scene.tsx`, `Simulation.tsx` (entry paths)
- Physics authority model: Rapier RigidBody usage present in prefabs (prefab + systems follow Rapier-first approach)
- Combat systems: Covered by weapons/ projectile/ damage systems linked above; AoE and homing behavior implemented in `ProjectileSystem`.
- AI: Basic state machine and perception implemented; needs refinement for robust behaviors and telemetry.
- Deterministic testing: Seeded RNG present and unit tests exist, but end-to-end deterministic harness and headless render determinism are not fully implemented.

## Verification performed

- I inspected the codebase to confirm the above items (key reads included `src/utils/seededRng.ts`, `src/systems/ProjectileSystem.ts`, `src/systems/DamageSystem.ts`, `src/robots/robotPrefab.tsx`, `src/systems/AISystem.ts`, `playwright/tests/smoke.spec.ts`).
- I ran repository searches for keywords (e.g., `gltf`, `GLTFLoader`, `RespawnSystem`, `ScoringSystem`, `ScoreBoard`, `useFeature`) and found no matching source files, indicating those features are not present yet.
- The `plan/handoverreport.md` file was created/updated in this commit and linted for simple markdown spacing.

## Recommended next steps (priority order)

1. Respawn & Scoring (high priority) — Implement `src/systems/RespawnSystem.ts`, `src/systems/ScoringSystem.ts`, and a minimal `src/components/ui/ScoreBoard.tsx` to close gameplay loop for demos and tests.
2. glTF loader & asset store (medium priority) — Add `src/assets/loader.ts` and `src/assets/assetStore.ts` so models can replace procedural prefabs later.
3. CI: run Playwright smoke on PRs (medium priority) — Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `npm ci && npm run playwright:install && npm run playwright:test` against a dev server (or the Playwright test harness used in the repo).
4. Deterministic E2E harness (low/medium) — Build on `src/utils/seededRng.ts` to enable deterministic simulation runs for fast headless validation (useful for regression testing of combat determinism).
5. Performance: projectile pooling and profiling (low) — Add an object pool for projectiles and a micro-benchmark harness.

## Quick notes for the follow-up implementer

- When implementing Respawn/Scoring, use the existing `DeathEvent` emitted by `DamageSystem.ts` as the hook for scoring and respawn logic.
- Prefer Rapier RigidBody as the authority for transforms; read and follow patterns in `robotPrefab.tsx` and `Scene.tsx` to avoid desync.
- Keep tests small and focused; add Vitest unit tests for Respawn and Scoring before wiring UI.
- For Playwright CI, prefer the existing `playwright/tests/smoke.spec.ts` selector strategy (`#status`, `canvas`) and ensure the dev server is started in background on the expected port.

## Status of this report

- Author: automated repository inspection by the assistant (reads performed on the repository files listed above).
- Current file: `plan/handoverreport.md` (this file)
- Verification: file written 2025-09-17 and validated for presence; code evidence referenced above.

If you want, I can now implement the top-priority follow-up (Respawn + Scoring) with tests and a minimal UI, or I can first add the Playwright CI workflow — tell me which to start with.
