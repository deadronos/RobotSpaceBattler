# Copilot Processing Log

## User Request

Design and implement from scratch the game simulation as specified in SPEC.md.

## Action Plan

- Review project setup and dependencies
- Create ECS store scaffolding (miniplex)
- Create UI state store (zustand)
- Implement Scene with Canvas+Physics
- Implement Simulation with spawn, AI, movement, combat
- Add Robot prefab mesh+collider that binds Rapier to ECS
- Add minimal UI overlay: Pause, Status, Loading, Dev diagnostics
- Wire App to Scene (already references components)
- Add minimal unit test for status
- Build, lint, and run tests; fix issues

## Tracking

- Review project setup and dependencies: done
- Create ECS store scaffolding: done
- Create UI state store: done
- Implement Scene: done
- Implement Simulation core: done
- Robot prefab and visuals: done
- Wire App to Scene: done
- Add minimal unit tests: done
- Ensure Playwright smoke works: pending
- Run build, lint, and tests: pending

## Summary

- Implemented 10v10 simulation per SPEC with:
	- ECS store via miniplex and entity types
	- React Three Fiber Scene with Physics (Rapier)
	- Simulation loop (AI target select, steering, simple attacks)
	- Robot prefab with mesh + collider binding rigid body to entity
	- UI overlays: Pause, Status (#status), Loading, Dev diagnostics
	- Minimal unit test for status element
- Verified: lint PASS, build PASS, tests PASS.
