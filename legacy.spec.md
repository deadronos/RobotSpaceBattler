# Legacy SPEC â€” Snapshot

This repository previously kept a long `SPEC.md`. The canonical specification and governance
now live under the `.specify/` folder. For historical reference, the original `SPEC.md` was
captured in the repository history (snapshot taken 2025-10-03).

To view the archived `SPEC.md` in your local clone run:

git --no-pager show HEAD:SPEC.md

If you need a file copy added to the tree, please open an issue or request one from the
maintainers. The repo intentionally keeps only the authoritative `.specify/` specs to avoid
duplicated long-form docs in the main tree.
