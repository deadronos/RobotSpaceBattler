# Milestone 01 â€” Kickoff & Discovery

1. Goal
   - Rapidly review the codebase and project docs to establish a common understanding and scope for the following milestones.

2. Deliverables
   - Decision log (assumptions & trade-offs)
   - Prioritized feature list
   - Asset inventory (textures, models, placeholders)
   - Risk register
   - Short timeline (12-week proposed roadmap)

3. Tasks
   - Read `SPEC.md`, `src/components/Simulation.tsx`, and key systems (`src/systems/*`) and ECS (`src/ecs/*`).
   - Record immediate blockers (missing assets, API mismatches).
   - Capture existing tests and known failing cases.
   - Propose a minimal first PR to unblock parallel work.

4. Timeline
   - 3 working days for the initial discovery artifact.

5. Risks
   - Hidden assumptions in `SPEC.md` vs. implementation.
   - Missing art assets or large binary files.

6. Acceptance Criteria
   - Decision log checked into `memory-bank/` or `docs/`.
   - Roadmap and priority list reviewed by the team.
