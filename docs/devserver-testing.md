# Dev server UI testing notes


Date: 2025-10-19

Test target: `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server)

## Summary

I opened the running dev server in Chrome DevTools and exercised the main HUD UI. The app loads
successfully and responds to UI interactions. No runtime errors were observed in the console and
network requests returned 200 or cached 304 responses.


## Actions performed (chronological)

- Opened a new DevTools page and navigated to http://localhost:5173. The page title shown in
  DevTools: "Space Station Autobattler".
- Took an accessibility-style DOM snapshot to inspect structure (team panels, HUD buttons, stats).
  Key nodes observed: "Battle Status" heading, "BATTLE IN PROGRESS" label, control buttons
  (Pause Battle, Enable/Disable Cinematic, Hide HUD, Settings), and team overview panels for
  Red Team and Blue Team.
- Captured a full-page screenshot of the initial load (see docs/screenshots/initial-01.png).
- Inspected console messages: only Vite connect logs and an informational React DevTools hint.
  No errors or stack traces.
- Inspected network requests: main app scripts and CSS loaded; responses were 200 or 304
  (cached). No 4xx/5xx errors.
- Interacted with the UI: clicked "Pause Battle", verified elapsed time and team stats updated in
  the snapshot; clicked "Enable Cinematic" which toggled to "Disable Cinematic"; opened HUD
  settings and toggled visual quality buttons (High, Medium, Low). Each interaction updated UI
  state and produced no console errors.
- Captured screenshots after interactions (see docs/screenshots/after-interaction-01.png,
  docs/screenshots/after-interaction-02.png).


## Console summary

- [vite] connecting... / [vite] connected. (normal Vite HMR messages)
- Info message recommending React DevTools (non-error)


## Network summary

- Requests completed successfully. Notable success responses:

  - GET / -> 200
  - GET /src/main.tsx -> 200
  - Many module chunks under /node_modules/.vite/deps/ -> 200

- Several files returned 304 (cached) which is normal for iterative dev reloads. No failed loads
  observed.


## UI checks (high level)

- Main HUD loads and displays expected data: elapsed time, FPS, team counts, weapon counts,
  entities.
- Control buttons are interactive and toggle state (pause, cinematic disable/enable, hide HUD).
- Settings drawer opens and quality toggles update pressed state.
- No visible layout breaks or missing assets on a desktop viewport.


## Potential follow-ups

- Record and attach the actual PNG screenshots from DevTools to `docs/screenshots/` for archival
  and QA review. The DevTools snapshot tool used here captured screenshots in the session; export
  and add the PNGs to the repo if desired.
- Run the app in a mobile viewport to verify responsiveness and HUD scaling.
- Add Playwright end-to-end tests to cover these control flows (pause, toggle cinematic, open
  settings, change quality).


## Files referenced (placeholders)

- docs/screenshots/initial-01.png (initial full-page screenshot)
- docs/screenshots/after-interaction-01.png (after pausing / toggling cinematic)
- docs/screenshots/after-interaction-02.png (settings drawer / quality toggles)

## Conclusion

The dev server and UI appear to be functioning correctly in the tested flows. No runtime errors or
network failures were detected. The interactive HUD controls respond as expected.

## Notes about screenshots

- During this session I captured full-page screenshots using the Chrome DevTools page. The
  DevTools snapshot and screenshot artifacts were recorded during the session. Add the exported
  PNGs to `docs/screenshots/` if you want them committed in the repository. I left placeholder
  file paths in this document for traceability.

## Next steps

- Archive the session screenshots into `docs/screenshots/` and reference them inline.
- Add Playwright E2E tests to automate the control flows exercised here.
- Test mobile/tablet responsive behavior and run visual regression checks if desired.
