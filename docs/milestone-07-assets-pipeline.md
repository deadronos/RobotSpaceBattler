# Milestone 07 â€” Assets & Art Pipeline

1. Goal
   - Define an artist-friendly pipeline for models and textures with clear conventions and lightweight import tooling.

2. Deliverables
   - `assets/` layout and naming conventions
   - Export guidelines for glTF (materials, LODs, DRACO compression)
   - Texture pack and recommended sizes/formats (KTX2/PNG/WEBP)
   - Small import helper script or docs for adding assets to the game

3. Tasks
   - Create `assets/` directories and example placeholders.
   - Document glTF export settings and LOD approach.
   - Add a small importer or example `public/` placement instructions.

4. Timeline
   - 1-2 sprints to document and scaffold.

5. Risks
   - Large artist files being committed to repo.
   - Tooling differences across artists' setups.

6. Acceptance Criteria
   - Clear docs and at least one example asset that loads in Simulation.
