   - QA checklist and basic playtest notes

3. Tasks
   - Compose environment tiles and spawn waves of robots using the evolution system.
   - Add toggles for deterministic mode and diagnostics.
   - Run internal playtests and iterate on difficulty and visuals.

4. Timeline
   - 2-3 sprints after core systems are in place.

5. Risks
