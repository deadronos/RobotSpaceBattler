# Specification Quality Checklist: 3D simulation fight graphics

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - Note: The "Next steps" section mentions Playwright and screenshot diffs. Recommend
    moving specific tool names to the implementation plan (plan.md) to keep the spec
    strictly technology-agnostic.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (minor exception noted above)

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Validation Notes

- Overall status: PASS with a minor TODO. The spec is ready for planning after moving a
  short implementation/tooling note from the spec into the plan (e.g., Playwright mention
  in Next steps). This is a low-risk editorial change.

### Remaining minor action

- Move explicit test-tool mentions (Playwright, screenshot diffs) from the spec's Next
  steps to the plan or tasks where specific tooling is appropriate.
