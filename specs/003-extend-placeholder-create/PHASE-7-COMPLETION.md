# ✅ Phase 7 Complete — Handoff Report to Phase 8

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-19  
**Regression Verified**: ✅ YES (406/407 tests passing)  
**Status**: Ready for Phase 8 planning

---

## What Was Accomplished: Phase 7 (T050–T056)

### Live Match Playback & Real-Time Rendering

Phase 7 unified live simulation rendering with deterministic replay by implementing:

1. **Live Trace Capture** (T050)
   - `src/hooks/useLiveMatchTrace.ts` hook
   - Captures spawn, move, fire, damage, death events
   - Assigns sequenceId for deterministic tie-breaking
   - Tracks RNG seed and metadata

2. **Real-Time Rendering** (T051)
   - Wired `useLiveMatchTrace` to `Scene.tsx`
   - Removed static placeholder components
   - Dynamic entity rendering from live trace
   - HUD shows live entity count and progress

3. **Quality Toggle UI** (T052)
   - Button in `ControlStrip.tsx` for High/Medium/Low quality
   - UI store integration for quality selector
   - Visual changes without affecting trace or outcome

4. **Between-Rounds UI** (T053)
   - `BetweenRoundsUI.tsx` displays match results
   - Rematch button (new RNG seed)
   - Team selection screen
   - Export trace as JSON

5. **Unit Tests** (T054)
   - 7 tests for spawn/move/fire/damage/death event capture
   - sequenceId ordering validation
   - RNG metadata recording verification

6. **End-to-End Tests** (T055)
   - Match renders from spawn to victory
   - Quality toggle during active match
   - Rematch flow validation

7. **Regression Verification** (T056) ✅
   - `npm run test` → **406/407 passing** (1 skipped)
   - `npm run lint` → **0 errors**
   - `npm run test:coverage` → **60.21% statements**
   - All existing systems stable

---

## Deliverables

### Code Changes
- ✅ `src/hooks/useLiveMatchTrace.ts` (live trace capture)
- ✅ `src/components/match/BetweenRoundsUI.tsx` (results UI)
- ✅ `src/components/hud/ControlStrip.tsx` (quality toggle)
- ✅ `src/components/Scene.tsx` (rendering integration)
- ✅ 3 E2E test suites (live rendering, quality toggle, deterministic replay)

### Test Coverage
- ✅ 7 new unit tests in `liveTrace.test.ts`
- ✅ 3 new E2E test suites (38 test cases total)
- ✅ 406/407 existing tests remain passing
- ✅ 0 regressions detected

### Documentation
- ✅ Phase 7 implementation documented
- ✅ Quick start guide created
- ✅ API contracts preserved

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

**None detected.** All regression tests pass. No known issues pending for Phase 8.

---

## Transition to Phase 8

### Prerequisites Met

✅ Phase 7 complete and verified  
✅ 406+ tests passing  
✅ 0 lint errors  
✅ 60%+ coverage maintained  
✅ No breaking changes  

### Phase 8 Ready to Start

Phase 8 addresses **constitutional compliance** (FR-011): refactor three oversized files.

**Target Files**:
- `src/ecs/world.ts` (470 LOC) → T058, T062
- `src/systems/matchTrace/matchPlayer.ts` (391 LOC) → T059, T063
- `src/hooks/useCameraControls.ts` (342 LOC) → T060, T061

**Phase 8 Structure**:
- Tasks: T057–T066 (10 tasks)
- Effort: ~21 hours (3–4 days)
- Approach: Planning → Extraction → Validation
- Risk: Low (all extractions have unit tests first)

**Documentation**:
- ✅ `tasks.md` updated with Phase 8 (full task descriptions)
- ✅ `COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md` created (Phase 7–8 overview)
- ✅ `PHASE-8-QUICKSTART.md` created (work breakdown + checklists)

### Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Review Phase 8 documentation
2. **Planning Phase** (T057–T060): Create detailed refactor plans with API contracts
3. **Extraction Phase** (T061–T063): Execute code movements with test validation
4. **Validation Phase** (T064–T066): Verify compliance and document outcomes

## Team Handoff Notes

### For Phase 8 Lead

- Phase 7 is **100% complete** and **fully tested**
- Regression test (T056) confirms no regressions
- Phase 8 planning tasks (T057–T060) can start immediately (all parallelizable)
- Estimated timeline: 3–4 days with parallel planning

### Code Quality

- All code follows constitutional standards (except 3 files in Phase 8 scope)
- Test coverage stable at 60%
- No technical debt introduced by Phase 7

### Risk Assessment

**Phase 8 Risk**: Low–Medium

- **Why Low**: Extractions have unit tests written first; API preservation strategy
- **Why Medium**: Three interdependent modules; sequencing matters
- **Mitigation**: Full test suite validates after each extraction; rollback plan documented
