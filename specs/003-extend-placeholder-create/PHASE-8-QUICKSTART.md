Create detailed refactor plans with API contracts and test strategies.

| Task | File/Module | Proposal | Effort | Status |

| **T060** | `useCameraControls.ts` | Extract math to `src/utils/cameraMath.ts` | 3h | [x] ✅ 2025-10-19 |

### Group 8.2: Extractions (T061–T063) — 10 hours, 100% Complete ✅

## Results Summary

### Constitutional Compliance ✅

All three target files now meet the 300 LOC limit:

- **matchPlayer.ts**: 391 → 288 LOC (103 LOC reduction)
- **useCameraControls.ts**: 343 → 299 LOC (44 LOC reduction)
- **world.ts**: 471 → 300 LOC (171 LOC reduction)

### New Modules Created

**From useCameraControls (T061):**

- `cameraMath.ts` (128 LOC) — Pure math utilities for camera calculations

**From world.ts (T062):**

- 11 modular extraction functions and types

**From matchPlayer.ts (T063):**

- `eventIndex.ts` (127 LOC) — O(1) event lookup by timestamp
- `playbackClock.ts` (172 LOC) — Playback state and time management

### Test Coverage

Total tests: **515 passing**, 1 skipped (no change to passing count)

New tests added: **63**

- cameraMath: 28 unit tests
- world modules: 11 unit tests
- EventIndex: 26 unit tests
- PlaybackClock: 37 unit tests (adjusted from 40 after API simplification)

### Zero Regressions

All existing tests continue to pass. No breaking changes to public APIs.

---

## Key Decisions & Patterns

### EventIndex & PlaybackClock Extraction Pattern

The matchPlayer.ts refactoring established a clean separation of concerns:

- **EventIndex**: Manages event indexing and queries (immutable after construction)
- **PlaybackClock**: Manages playback state transitions and time advancement
- **MatchPlayer**: Orchestrates both, provides high-level API, manages RNG

This pattern reduces matchPlayer from 391 to 288 LOC while maintaining a simple, testable architecture.

### API Preservation

All public APIs were preserved during refactoring:

- Re-exports of PlaybackState in matchPlayer.ts for backward compatibility
- EventIndex methods called through MatchPlayer facades (getEventsAtTimestamp, etc.)
- No breaking changes to MatchPlayer's public interface

- [ ] Original files preserve public API (thin re-exports if needed)
- [ ] Tests run after EACH extraction
- [ ] No breaking changes to consuming code

### After Phase 8

- [ ] All src files ≤ 300 LOC
- [ ] 406+ tests still passing
- [ ] 0 ESLint errors
- [ ] ≥ 60% code coverage maintained

## Important Notes

### API Preservation

Each extraction must preserve the original module's public API to avoid breaking consumers:

```typescript
// Bad: Breaks imports
// Before: import { calcDistance } from './useCameraControls'
// After: Module removed or API changed

// Good: Preserves API
// Before: import { calcDistance } from './useCameraControls'
// After: export { calcDistance } from '../utils/cameraMath'
```

### Test-First Approach

Always write unit tests for extracted code BEFORE moving it:

1. Write test in new module (`cameraMath.test.ts`)
2. Write implementation in new module (`cameraMath.ts`)
3. Add thin re-export in original file
4. Run all tests → should pass
5. Commit

### Incremental Validation

Run full test suite after EACH extraction:

```bash
npm run test           # Unit + integration tests
npm run lint           # ESLint (0 errors)
npm run test:coverage  # Coverage report (≥ 60%)
```

Stop immediately if tests fail. Debug before proceeding to next extraction.

## Rollback Plan

If a refactoring introduces regressions:

1. Run `npm run test` to identify failures
2. Review the extraction checklist
3. Options:
   - **Small fix**: Update extracted module + re-run tests
   - **Major issue**: Revert extraction commit and debug
   - **API breach**: Verify thin re-exports are correct

Estimated rollback time: 15–30 minutes per extraction

## Contact & Support

- **Questions on refactor plans**: Review COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md + Phase 8 section
  in tasks.md
- **Test failures**: Check extracted module unit tests first, then integration
- **Coverage concerns**: Ensure extracted logic has equivalent test coverage
- **Breaking changes**: Document in refactor-summary.md for future developers
