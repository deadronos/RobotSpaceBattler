# Specification Quality Checklist: 3D Team Fight — Extend 001 & 002

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - PASS: Spec avoids implementation-level instructions; focuses on behavior and contracts.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - PASS: User stories and acceptance scenarios describe the value (demo, validation, visual quality).
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - PASS: Language is non-technical and explains value and testing steps.
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - PASS: User Scenarios, Requirements, Key Entities, Success Criteria and Out of scope are present.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - PASS: No remaining NEEDS CLARIFICATION tokens found in spec.
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - PASS: FRs map to observable behaviors (spawn, render, record trace, HUD).
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - PASS: Success criteria include percentages, time bounds, and tolerances.
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - PASS: Metrics reference outcomes not tools or frameworks.
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - PASS: Each user story includes acceptance scenarios; core flows covered.
- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - PASS: Spawn failures, renderer lag, and asset load failures included.
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - PASS: User confirmed exclusions are recorded in the "Out of scope" section: networked multiplayer excluded; persistent match history/leaderboards/cloud storage excluded (local JSON export allowed); AI training/learning excluded.
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - PASS: Spec references reuse of contracts from specs 001 and 002 and lists assumptions.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - PASS: FR-009 now includes FR-009-A acceptance checklist enumerating contract fields to validate; other FRs include acceptance scenarios.
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - PASS: Primary flows (run match, toggle visuals, replay) are present.
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - PASS: Success criteria are realistic and mapped to behaviors.
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - PASS: Spec remains technology-agnostic.

## Notes

- The user confirmed the following exclusions which are recorded in the spec `Out of scope` section:
  - Network play / online multiplayer: excluded
  - Persistent match history, leaderboards, cloud storage: excluded; local export to JSON is allowed
  - Non-visual simulation features (AI training, learning models): excluded

Spec is now ready for planning (`/speckit.plan`).

  - PASS: Each user story includes acceptance scenarios; core flows covered.
- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - PASS: Spawn failures, renderer lag, and asset load failures included.
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
  - FAIL: Scope references extending specs 001 and 002 but does not explicitly enumerate what is out-of-scope (e.g., networked multiplayer, persistent leaderboards). Recommend clarifying exact boundaries.
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - PASS: Spec references reuse of contracts from specs 001 and 002 and lists assumptions.

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - PARTIAL: Many FRs are observable, but some (e.g., FR-009 compatibility with existing contracts) need explicit acceptance checks (link to contract fields).
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - PASS: Primary flows (run match, toggle visuals, replay) are present.
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - PASS: Success criteria are realistic and mapped to behaviors.
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - PASS: Spec remains technology-agnostic.

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Remaining work before planning:
  1. Clarify scope exclusions (networking, persistent stats, AI learning) — required to mark "Scope is clearly bounded" as PASS.
  2. Add explicit acceptance checks for FR-009 (compatibility with specs 001/002): list critical contract fields to validate during acceptance testing.
