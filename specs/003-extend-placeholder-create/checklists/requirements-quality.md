# Requirements Quality Checklist

Feature: ../spec.md | Audience: Implementation team pre-implementation gate

---

## Completeness

- [x] CHK001: Primary FRs for match lifecycle listed?
  - PASS: Spec FR-001 through FR-010 documented

- [x] CHK002: MatchTrace event types enumerated?
  - PASS: Spec FR-005 lists spawn, move, fire, hit, damage, death, score

- [x] CHK003: Team/Unit data shapes present and unambiguous?
  - PASS: Spec FR-009-A and data-model.md define both schemas

- [x] CHK004: Success/failure end-states documented?
  - PASS: Spec FR-006, FR-008 cover HUD, cinematic, winner determination

## Clarity

- [x] CHK005: timestampMs/frameIndex definition precise?
  - PASS: Spec Clarifications define RNG timing and monotonic constraints

- [x] CHK006: sequenceId assignment and tie-break semantics clear?
  - PASS: data-model.md specifies strictly increasing tie-break integer

- [x] CHK007: "Placeholder asset" and "fallback" quantified?
  - PARTIAL: FR-007 requires fallback; visual fidelity deferred to Phase 4

- [x] CHK008: RNG seed record/replay behavior specified?
  - PASS: Spec Clarifications define rngSeed and rngAlgorithm in trace

## Consistency

- [x] CHK009: Unit/Robot fields align across contracts?
  - PASS: FR-009-A fields match spawn contract and MatchTrace references

- [x] CHK010: Naming standardized (teamId vs team)?
  - PASS: data-model.md standardizes on teamId across all schemas

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] CHK011: Criteria measurable and verifiable?
  - PASS: Spec SC-001 through SC-005 specify ±16ms, 2s, 95% targets

- [x] CHK012: Visual quality toggle pass/fail conditions defined?
  - PASS: Spec User Story 2 defines High/Low modes and determinism

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK013: Primary/alternate/exception flows covered?
  - PASS: Spec Edge Cases covers spawn failure, lag, asset missing

- [x] CHK014: Record/replay path end-to-end described?
  - PASS: Spec FR-005 and US3 document trace recording and playback

## Edge Cases

- [x] CHK015: Spawn failure behavior specified?
  - PASS: Spec Edge Cases: abort gracefully, use fallback assets

- [x] CHK016: Renderer lag strategy measurable and documented?
  - PASS: Spec Clarifications: hybrid timing with ±16ms tolerance

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK017: Performance targets quantified?
  - PASS: Spec SC-001 through SC-005: 60 fps, ±16ms replay, 95% success

- [x] CHK018: Observability requirements specified?
  - PASS: Spec FR-010: debug logging, match record, render metrics

- [x] CHK019: Accessibility requirements considered?
  - PARTIAL: Playwright tests exist; details deferred to implementation

- [x] CHK020: Asset fallback NFR defined (no crash required)?
  - PASS: Spec FR-007: graceful fallback, 100% resilience required

## Dependencies and Assumptions

- [x] CHK021: External contracts referenced with field mappings?
  - PASS: Spec FR-009 maps to specs/001 and specs/002

- [x] CHK022: Runtime assumptions documented?
  - PASS: Spec Constitution: Chrome/Edge 120+, Node 18+

## Ambiguities and Conflicts

- [x] CHK023: Contradictory statements present?
  - PASS: No conflicts detected; timing consistent

- [x] CHK024: Vague adjectives quantified or marked deferred?
  - PARTIAL: "Enhanced effects" deferred to Phase 4 implementation

## Traceability

- [x] CHK025: Checklist items cite spec sections?
  - PASS: 100% include FR-###/SC-### or Spec section references

- [x] CHK026: Explicit mapping scheme documented?
  - PASS: tasks.md defines T### IDs mapped to FRs
