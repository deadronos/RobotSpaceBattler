# Requirements Quality Checklist — requirements-quality.md

Purpose: Unit-style checklist to validate that the feature requirements in `specs/003-extend-placeholder-create/spec.md` are complete, clear, consistent, measurable, and testable. Audience: PR reviewers (primary). Depth: Release-gate (formal) with Functional + Non-Functional coverage.

Created: 2025-10-18

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are the primary functional requirements for starting and completing a full automated match explicitly listed? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are all MatchTrace event types required by the system (spawn, move, fire, hit, damage, death, score) enumerated and referenced in the spec? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are the Team and Unit data shapes (id, modelRef, teamId, maxHealth, spawnPoints) present and unambiguous in the spec? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009-A]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are success and failure end-states defined for a match (winner determination, HUD summary, cinematic sweep)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006, FR-008]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 - Is the `timestampMs` timebase and optional `frameIndex` definition precise and unambiguous (units, epoch, monotonicity)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK006 - Is the meaning and usage of `sequenceId` documented (how it is assigned and used to break ties)? [Clarity, Spec §Key Entities — MatchTrace]
- [ ] CHK007 - Are terms like "placeholder asset" and "fallback" quantified (what visual fidelity or metadata must a placeholder include)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK008 - Is the RNG seed behaviour specified clearly: where it is recorded, how replays must consume it, and which RNG algorithm or compatibility constraints apply? [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications RNG]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK009 - Do the data shape requirements for `Unit`/`Robot` in FR-009-A align with references in other sections (e.g., spawn contract fields, MatchTrace events)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-009-A]
- [ ] CHK010 - Are any naming mismatches present (e.g., `teamId` vs `team`) that could cause ambiguity across contracts? [Consistency, Spec §FR-009-A]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK011 - Are acceptance criteria measurable and verifiable (e.g., replay tolerance ±16ms, HUD shown within 2s)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002, SC-005]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are pass/fail conditions for visual quality toggles defined (what constitutes acceptable behavior when switching High/Low modes)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Story 2]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 - Are primary, alternate, and exception flows covered: normal match flow, asset-load failure, renderer lag, incomplete spawn? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK014 - Are deterministic replay and record/replay path described end-to-end (record, store, playback)? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK015 - Is the behavior specified when team members fail to spawn or when models are missing mid-match? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK016 - Is the renderer-fall-behind strategy (interpolation/extrapolation policy) and allowable drift documented and measurable? [Edge Case/Measurability, Spec §Clarifications]

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- [ ] CHK017 - Are performance targets quantified for critical paths (e.g., target frame rate or renderer budget, replay tolerance, CPU/GPU expectations)? [Performance, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK018 - Are observability requirements specified (structured logs, match trace export, metrics to detect replay drift or asset failures)? [Observability, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK019 - Are accessibility requirements considered for HUD and cinematic presentation (keyboard navigation, reduced-motion preference)? [Accessibility, Spec §tests/reduced-motion references]
- [ ] CHK020 - Is asset fallback behaviour defined as an NFR (levels of degradation allowed, expected placeholders, and how these affect acceptance)? [Availability/Resilience, Spec §FR-007]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK021 - Are all external or reused contracts referenced and versioned (specs/001 and specs/002) and their required fields enumerated? [Dependencies, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK022 - Are assumptions about the runtime environment or platform (browser baseline, WebGL support, Node/test environment) stated and justified? [Assumptions, Spec §Constitution target platforms]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK023 - Are there any contradictory statements (e.g., inconsistent timing tolerances or conflicting HUD timing) that need reconciliation? [Conflict]
- [ ] CHK024 - Have vague adjectives been quantified (e.g., "enhanced effects", "soft shadows") or marked as deferred? [Ambiguity]

## Traceability

- [ ] CHK025 - Do at least 80% of checklist items include a trace reference to a spec section or FR/SC identifier? [Traceability]
- [ ] CHK026 - Is there an explicit suggested ID scheme or mapping for requirements → tests → artifacts (e.g., FR-### → CHK### → Test file)? [Traceability]

Notes:
- This checklist is intended to validate the written requirements, not to test implementation behavior. Each item should be answered by checking the spec text and related artifacts (schemas, examples).
- File created automatically by `/speckit.checklist` run for `003-extend-placeholder-create`.
