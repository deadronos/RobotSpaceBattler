# Feature Specification: 3D Team vs Team Autobattler Game Simulation

**Feature Branch**: `001-3d-team-vs`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i want to have a 3d team vs team (red vs blue) autobattler gamesimulation with humanoid robots and lasers/guns/rockets"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a player, I want to observe an autonomous 3D battle simulation between two teams of humanoid robots (red vs blue) fighting with ranged weapons in a space-station arena, so that I can watch tactical combat unfold with realistic physics, lighting, and visual effects.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the simulation is loaded, **When** the user starts the game, **Then** 10 red robots and 10 blue robots spawn in designated starting zones in the arena.

2. **Given** robots are spawned, **When** the simulation runs, **Then** robots autonomously move, target enemies, and fire weapons (lasers/guns/rockets) without player input.

3. **Given** a robot is hit by a weapon, **When** the damage threshold is exceeded, **Then** the robot is eliminated from the battlefield and removed from active simulation.

4. **Given** one team has eliminated all opponents, **When** no enemies remain, **Then** the simulation declares the winning team and displays the result.

5. **Given** the arena has lighting and shadows enabled, **When** robots and projectiles move, **Then** realistic shadows and lighting effects are rendered in real-time.

6. **Given** the simulation is running, **When** the user observes the arena, **Then** the camera provides a clear view of the battlefield and allows observation of combat.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when both teams are eliminated simultaneously?
- How does the system handle performance degradation when many projectiles are active?
- What happens if robots cannot find valid targets or pathfinding fails?
- How does the system handle weapon collision detection with arena obstacles?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST spawn exactly 10 red team robots and 10 blue team robots at simulation start in designated starting zones.

- **FR-002**: System MUST provide autonomous AI control for all robots (movement, targeting, weapon firing) without player input.

- **FR-003**: System MUST support three weapon types: lasers, guns (projectile-based), and rockets with distinct visual and behavior characteristics.

- **FR-004**: System MUST detect weapon hits on robots and apply damage calculations to determine robot elimination.

- **FR-005**: System MUST remove eliminated robots from the active simulation and battlefield.

- **FR-006**: System MUST determine and display the winning team when one team has eliminated all opponents.

- **FR-007**: System MUST render the arena as a space-station environment with proper directional and ambient lighting.

- **FR-008**: System MUST render real-time dynamic shadows for robots, projectiles, and arena geometry.

- **FR-009**: System MUST render humanoid robot meshes for all 20 robots with team color differentiation (red vs blue).

- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain interactive frame rates (target 60 fps on modern Chromium browsers).

- **FR-011**: System MUST use an ECS architecture with Miniplex for game logic, queries, and system updates.

- **FR-012**: System MUST handle physics interactions (robot movement, projectile trajectories, collisions) using a physics engine.

- **FR-013**: System MUST provide a camera system allowing observation of the battlefield from appropriate viewing angles.

- **FR-014**: System MUST initialize and reset the simulation state for replay or restart scenarios.

### Performance & Scale

- **FR-015**: System MUST support 10 vs 10 robot battles (20 total entities) as the initial configuration.

- **FR-016**: System MUST handle multiple active projectiles (lasers, bullets, rockets) without significant frame rate degradation.

- **FR-017**: System MUST render shadows and lighting effects without dropping below 30 fps on the target platform (Chrome 120+, Edge 120+).

### Key Entities

- **Robot**: Autonomous humanoid combatant with team affiliation (red/blue), health/damage state, position, orientation, weapon type, AI state (targeting, movement).

- **Weapon**: Offensive capability with type (laser/gun/rocket), damage value, fire rate, projectile behavior, visual effect.

- **Projectile**: Active weapon discharge with trajectory, velocity, collision detection, damage on impact, visual representation.

- **Arena**: Space-station battlefield environment with spawn zones, boundaries, obstacles, lighting configuration, camera anchor points.

- **Team**: Group of robots (red or blue) with team-level state (active count, eliminated count, victory condition).

- **Simulation State**: Overall game state including running/paused/completed status, winner determination, frame time, entity registry.

## Implementation Constraints

- **Target Browser Baseline**: Chrome 120+, Edge 120+ (modern Chromium-based browsers with WebGL 2.0 support).

- **Required Build Steps**: None for baseline compatibility; consider performance profiling and optimization for lower-end hardware.

- **File/Module Sizing**: Core game systems (ECS queries, AI, physics integration, rendering components) SHOULD be decomposed into modules ‚â§ 300 LOC. Larger systems MUST be split into dedicated hooks, components, and utility modules.

- **ECS Architecture**: High-level game logic MUST use and reuse Miniplex ECS queries following best practices documented at https://github.com/hmans/miniplex.
