- [ ] **T014** ‚¨ú [P] Performance management system (quality scaling, time scale, warning overlay)
  - Status: Not Started
  - Files: `src/systems/performanceManager.ts` (estimated 200 LOC), `src/components/PerformanceWarning.tsx` (estimated 80 LOC)
  - Acceptance: FR-021, FR-022, FR-023 (toggleable quality scaling, simulation slowdown, non-intrusive warnings)

All parallel [P] tasks can run simultaneously within their phase
```

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.1 Setup (can run simultaneously)
```bash
# T002, T003, T004, T005 are independent
npm run setup:lint & npm run setup:ci & npm install @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei & npm install @react-three/rapier
```

### Phase 3.2 Tests (can run simultaneously)
```bash
# T006, T007, T008, T009 are independent contract/integration tests
vitest tests/contracts/robot-spawning.test.ts &
vitest tests/contracts/weapon-balance.test.ts &
vitest tests/integration/ai-behavior.test.ts &
vitest tests/integration/victory-flow.test.ts
```

### Phase 3.5 Polish (can run simultaneously)
```bash
# T014 and T015 are independent
vitest src/systems/performanceManager.test.ts & vitest src/hooks/useStatsTracking.test.ts
```

## Constitution Compliance Notes

### File Size Management
- **T013 Camera System**: Estimated 390 LOC total ‚Üí MUST decompose into:
  - `src/components/Camera.tsx` (core component, <240 LOC)
  - `src/hooks/useCameraControls.ts` (mouse/keyboard, <150 LOC)
  - `src/hooks/useTouchControls.ts` (touch/pinch, <100 LOC)
  - `src/hooks/useCinematicMode.ts` (auto-follow, <120 LOC)

- **T012 Weapon System**: Monitor closely, consider decomposition if exceeds 280 LOC:
  - `src/ecs/systems/weaponSystem.ts` (core logic)
  - `src/ecs/systems/weaponBalanceCalculator.ts` (rock-paper-scissors modifiers)

### TDD Gate Enforcement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKER**: T010, T011, T012 CANNOT start until T006-T009 tests are written and failing
- Current Status: T007 ‚úÖ failing (good), T008 üîÑ partially failing, T006 and T009 ‚¨ú not written yet

### Agentic AI Triggers
- T013: Complex camera system ‚Üí candidate for AI-assisted decomposition planning
- T014: Performance heuristics ‚Üí candidate for AI-suggested optimization patterns

## Notes
- Total tasks: 15 (3.1: 5 tasks, 3.2: 4 tasks, 3.3: 3 tasks, 3.4: 1 task, 3.5: 2 tasks)
- Completed: 4 tasks (27%)
- In Progress: 3 tasks (20%)
- Blocked: 1 task (7%)
- Not Started: 7 tasks (47%)
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD gate)
- Commit after each task completion
- Run `npm run check:source-size` before marking any task complete
