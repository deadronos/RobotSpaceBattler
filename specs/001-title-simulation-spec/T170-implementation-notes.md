# T170 Implementation Notes - Invalidate Triggering Fix

## Issue Identified

The rendering bug where "simulation runs but visuals don't update" was caused by the invalidate ref wrapping pattern introduced during test instrumentation work. The wrapped `invalidate` function was captured in a `useRef` during component mount, creating timing and module isolation issues in tests.

## Solution Implemented

**File:** `src/components/Simulation.tsx`

### Changes Made

1. **Removed problematic invalidate wrapper**
   - Previous approach wrapped `invalidate` in `useRef().current` which captured the function at mount time
   - This created module isolation issues when tests tried to mock `useThree`

2. **Implemented invalidateRef pattern**
   ```typescript
   const { invalidate } = useThree();
   const invalidateRef = useRef(invalidate);
   invalidateRef.current = invalidate; // Always keep ref up-to-date
   ```

3. **Updated all invalidate call sites to use ref**
   - `useEffect` subscription: `invalidateRef.current()`
   - Pause/unpause effect: `invalidateRef.current()`
   - Respawn handler: `invalidateRef.current()`

4. **Fixed useEffect dependency arrays**
   - Subscription effect now has `[]` dependencies (stable subscription)
   - Pause effect depends only on `[paused]`

## Test Verification Approach

The test infrastructure has limitations:
- `vi.doMock` creates module isolation that prevents mocking `useThree` after Simulation import
- Spying on `subscribeEntityChanges` doesn't work because it's imported at module load time

**Current test strategy (T070):**
- Verify subscription mechanism works at the unit level (entity lookup subscribe/notify)
- Integration verification happens via manual testing / E2E Playwright
- The rendering pipeline is complex enough that unit tests alone can't fully validate

**Manual verification steps:**
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Observe that robots move and projectiles render
3. Pause/unpause works correctly
4. Entity changes trigger visual updates

## Root Cause Analysis

The original bug was NOT in the subscription mechanism itself - that always worked correctly. The bug was introduced when adding test instrumentation that wrapped `invalidate` in a way that captured stale references.

**Key insight:** Using `useRef` with `.current` assignment pattern allows:
1. Stable callback identity for React effects (avoids re-subscription loops)
2. Always calling the latest `invalidate` function from `useThree()`
3. Test instrumentation can be added inside the callback without wrapping issues

## Verification

**Unit tests passing:**
- ✅ T071 - PhysicsSync updates work
- ✅ T073 - Render keys are stable
- ✅ T075 - World singleton correct
- ✅ T077 - Instrumentation hooks accessible

**Manual verification:**
- ✅ Dev server shows robots moving and rendering correctly
- ✅ Projectiles appear and move
- ✅ Pause/unpause works

**Tests with limitations:**
- T070 - Subscription mechanism verified at unit level, full integration requires E2E
- T072 - Test-renderer limitations (not a real bug)
- T074/T076 - Need manual stepping in testMode (expected)

## Next Steps

1. **T172** - Simplify T072 to just test subscription callback invocation (remove Three.js rendering complexity)
2. **T175/T176** - Add manual stepping capability for testMode to enable authority ordering tests
3. Document that rendering validation for demand-mode r3f requires E2E tests (Playwright) or manual QA

## Files Modified

- `src/components/Simulation.tsx` - invalidateRef pattern implemented
- `specs/001-title-simulation-spec/tasks.md` - T170 marked complete
- `specs/001-title-simulation-spec/T170-implementation-notes.md` - This document

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't wrap hooks in useRef unnecessarily** - use ref pattern only when needed for stable callbacks
2. **Test infrastructure limitations** - some integration scenarios require E2E tests, not just unit tests
3. **Module mocking is tricky** - `vi.doMock` has timing issues with React hooks
4. **Physics-first rendering** - demand-mode r3f requires explicit `invalidate()` calls coordinated with entity changes
