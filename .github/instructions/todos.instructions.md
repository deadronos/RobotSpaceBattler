- [x] review-002-spec-plan-tasks: Read and analyze `specs/002-3d-simulation-graphics/spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and `data-model.md` to determine scope: does 002 capture replacing placeholders or only set up 3D simulation? Produce notes of gaps and mapping to codebase (files/components). ðŸ”´
  _Confirmed acceptance criteria and mapped plan/tasks to codebase; see analysis notes._
- [x] analyze-scope-and-recommend: Decide whether to (A) refine 002 to include enrichment (teams, weapons, fight rendering) or (B) create a new `003-â€¦` spec/feature branch to add full simulation features. Provide pros/cons and recommended path and acceptance criteria. ðŸ”´
  _Recommended creating a new 003 feature spec for full simulation enrichment; summarized pros/cons and acceptance criteria._
- [x] propose-next-steps-and-branch-plan: Provide concrete next steps for the chosen approach: branch naming, checklist of work items (design, prototypes, tests, perf), who to involve, and minimal increments for landing safely. Include suggested tickets/tasks and acceptance tests. ðŸŸ¡
  _Included branch plan, minimal increments, and suggested tickets to create._
