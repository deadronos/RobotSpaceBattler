<todos title="update-memory-bank" agentRequirement="Review steps frequently throughout the conversation and DO NOT stop between steps unless they explicitly require it. Keep the todos updated using the todo_write tool (do not edit this file).">
- [x] create-core-memory-files: Create or update core memory-bank files in `/memory-bank/`: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md. Each should follow the structure described in `memory-bank.#instructions.md` and include current repository context and useful links (specs/ folder, AGENTS.md). ðŸ”´
  _Follow instructions in `.github/instructions/memory-bank.#instructions.md`. Keep files concise yet complete for future agents. Assumptions: Use repository info and existing specs for content; if missing details, summarize known project intent from `AGENTS.md` and `specs/`. Will create minimal but useful content._
- [x] ensure-tasks-folder-index: Ensure `memory-bank/tasks/_index.md` exists and contains a template task index as specified (In Progress / Pending / Completed sections). If `tasks/` dir missing, create it and add `_index.md`. ðŸŸ¡
- [-] add-designs-overview: Create `memory-bank/designs/README.md` summarizing the existing files (`ai-design.md`, `design.md`, `physics-sync-design.md`, `weapons-design.md`) and linking to specs where relevant. ðŸŸ¢
- [ ] finalize-and-commit-notes: Add a `memory-bank/README.md` describing the memory bank purpose and update log entries listing changes made with dates and author (Copilot agent). ðŸŸ¢
