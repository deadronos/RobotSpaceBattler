# `.github/prompts/`

This directory contains curated prompt templates sourced from the `github/awesome-copilot` collection.

Guidance:
- These are agent-oriented prompt templates intended as reusable starting points for automation or developer assistance.
- Several prompts assume privileged tooling (e.g., `editFiles`, `runCommands`, `fetch`) — keep them inert as templates until you run them with an agent that exposes the expected tools.
- Attribution: prompts were adapted from https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot
