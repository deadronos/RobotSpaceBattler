/**
 * Contract Test: Captain Election
 *
 * Validates FR-002 captain assignment/reassignment behavior:
 * - The system elects the active robot with the highest current health as captain.
 * - Deterministic tie-breakers are applied in order: (1) stats.kills, (2) distance to
 *   team's spawn center (smaller is preferred), (3) lexicographically smallest id.
 *
 * These tests are intentionally written as contract tests: they declare the minimal
 * test helpers the runtime must provide (initialization, setters, and a re-election
 * trigger). The tests will fail until the spawn/captain systems and helpers are
 * implemented according to the spec and data model.
