  EntityMapper tests were split into smaller files for maintainability:
  - entityMapper.basic.test.ts
  - entityMapper.snapshot.test.ts
  - entityMapper.complex.test.ts

  This placeholder keeps history and prevents the test runner from failing
  on the original filename. The actual tests live in the files listed above.
