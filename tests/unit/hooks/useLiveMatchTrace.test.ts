// Tests for useLiveMatchTrace have been split across three smaller files:
// - useLiveMatchTrace.init.test.ts
// - useLiveMatchTrace.behavior.test.ts
// - useLiveMatchTrace.edge.test.ts
//
// The original large file was kept for history; tests are now contained in the
// smaller files above. To keep Vitest from failing on an empty test file we
// register a skipped placeholder test suite here.
