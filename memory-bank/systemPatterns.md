# System Patterns â€” RobotSpaceBattler

**Last updated:** 2025-10-03

## Architecture overview

- Renderer: `src/components/Scene.tsx` creates the Three.js `Canvas` and wraps `Simulation` with `Physics`.
- Simulation: `src/components/Simulation.tsx` hosts spawn logic and per-step systems; it runs systems inside a deterministic fixed-step driver (`useFixedStepLoop`).
- ECS: `miniplex` is the lightweight component store (`src/ecs/miniplexStore.ts`). The project uses a small world controller and an `entityLookup` utility to track and notify render-time changes.

## Concrete patterns and utilities

- World & entity tracking:
  - `createWorldController` (wrapped by `miniplexStore`) builds the miniplex world and wires `onEntityAdded`/`onEntityRemoved` callbacks used by the `entityLookup` helper.
  - `subscribeEntityChanges` exposes a lightweight subscription hook used by `Simulation` to call `invalidate()` when entities change.
  - `getRenderKey(entity, fallbackIndex)` produces stable keys for React `key` props so adding/removing entities doesn't cause visual churn.

- Physics-first transforms:
  - Rapier `RigidBody` is the source of truth for physics-driven entities. Use `physicsSyncSystem` to copy authoritative Rapier transforms into ECS `position`/`rotation` components, and avoid direct mesh position mutation when a `RigidBody` exists.
  - Physics is run inside the `Physics` provider with `updateLoop="independent"` and a fixed `timeStep` so visual frames stay consistent with the physics timestep.

- Deterministic fixed-step loop:
  - `useFixedStepLoop` drives game systems with a fixed timestep and supplies a seeded RNG per tick. Systems receive the RNG and step time so tests can re-create behavior deterministically.
  - The renderer uses an on-demand frameloop (`frameloop="demand"`) and a small `TickDriver` component to enqueue frames at the requested Hz (default 60Hz) so frames are purposeful and pause/unpause is deterministic.

- Pause / resume handling:
  - Pause-related velocity capture/restore utilities exist (`capturePauseVel`, `restorePauseVel`, and helpers in `miniplexStore` that wrap `pauseVelocity` helpers) so when pausing the simulation we persist entity velocities and reapply them on resume.

## Recommended development patterns

- Small, focused systems: Export smaller functions from systems so they can be unit tested without Three.js or Rapier.
- Query design: When rendering prefabs (for example `Robot`), avoid requiring the `rigid` component in the render query; the prefab mounts the `rigid` on mount. Requiring `rigid` in the query can cause robots to never mount or render during initial setup.
- Keep side-effects localized: Systems should emit events (damage, projectile spawn, fx) that are processed by dedicated systems rather than doing large imperative side-effects inline in the render layer.

## Common pitfalls

- Mutating mesh transforms while a `RigidBody` is present leads to desync between physics and rendering.
- Large Simulation files become hard to test; split responsibilities and export pure helpers for unit tests.
- Forgetting to `invalidate()` after entity changes can lead to stale visuals when using on-demand rendering.
