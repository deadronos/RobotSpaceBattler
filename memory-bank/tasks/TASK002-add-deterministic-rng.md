# TASK002 - Add deterministic RNG helper

**Status:** Not Started

**Goal:** Create a seeded RNG utility so simulations and tests can be deterministic when needed.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- A small, well-documented RNG module (e.g. `src/utils/rng.ts`) with a seedable interface.
- Unit tests demonstrating repeatable sequences when the same seed is used.
