# [TASK022] Create granular design documents for key subsystems

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03

## Original Request
Add detailed design documents to `.specify/designs/` covering Weapons System, AI System, and Physics Sync with diagrams, interfaces, and implementation details.

## Thought Process
- Weapons System handles three resolution paths (hitscan/beam/projectile) with complex event flows and sourceId propagation
- AI System uses modular architecture (queries, perception, decisions) enabling pure unit tests
- Physics Sync is critical to understanding Rapier authority and pause/resume behavior
- Each subsystem deserves dedicated design doc with mermaid diagrams and code patterns

## Implementation Plan
- Review source files for each subsystem
- Extract component interfaces, system flows, and test patterns
- Create dedicated design documents with architecture diagrams
- Document common patterns, risks, and extension points
- Add mermaid sequence and state diagrams for clarity

## Progress Tracking
**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-03
- Created `.specify/designs/weapons-design.md` with weapon profiles, resolution systems, event flows
- Created `.specify/designs/ai-design.md` with state machine diagram, decision modules, test patterns
- Created `.specify/designs/physics-sync-design.md` with sync flow, pause/resume sequences, entity lifecycle
- All three docs include mermaid diagrams and code examples
- Created this task file and updated tasks/_index.md
