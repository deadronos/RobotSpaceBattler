# [TASK012] - Modular Tiles and Layout

Status: Completed
Added: 2025-09-17
Updated: 2025-09-17

## Original Request

Create modular floor/wall/corner tile components and compose a simple level layout suitable for the arena, using the shared materials.

## Thought Process

Modular components keep geometry simple and reusable; a small arena confirms scale, tiling, and materials in-context.

## Implementation Plan

- Create components in `src/components/environment/`:
  - `FloorTile`, `WallTile`, `CornerTile` (basic box/plane geometry; UVs tileable)
  - `EnvironmentLayout` composing a small arena (e.g., 10x10 floor, enclosing walls)
- Support props: tile size, height, material variant
- Ensure materials from `materials.ts` are passed and reused
- Optional: grid helper for debug placement

## Subtasks

| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 2.1 | Scaffold environment components folder and tile components | Completed | 2025-09-17 | Floor/Wall/Corner tile components created |
| 2.2 | Implement `EnvironmentLayout` with a basic arena | Completed | 2025-09-17 | 10Ã—10 arena with perimeter walls |
| 2.3 | Wire shared materials and verify tiling/UVs | Completed | 2025-09-17 | Shared material instances reused |
| 2.4 | Add quick story/demo in `Scene.tsx` behind a flag | Completed | 2025-09-17 | `ENABLE_ENVIRONMENT` toggle in Scene |

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tiles render with correct scale and materials; seams acceptable at typical distances
- `EnvironmentLayout` creates an arena with consistent tiling and wall heights
- Reuses shared materials (no unnecessary material instances)
