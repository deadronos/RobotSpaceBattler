# [TASK021] Capture implementation state â€” Create requirements & design docs

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03

## Original Request
Create memory-bank artifacts that capture the current implementation state: `memory-bank/requirements.md` (EARS-style requirements) and `memory-bank/designs/design.md` (architecture, interfaces, diagrams).

## Thought Process
- Read existing memory bank files to ensure alignment with project conventions and active context.
- Review core source files (`Simulation`, `Scene`, `miniplexStore`, `useFixedStepLoop`, `FixedStepDriver`, systems under `src/systems/`, robot prefabs) to gather present behaviors, public interfaces, and test coverage.
- Write EARS-style requirements that map to existing tests and explain acceptance checks.
- Produce a design snapshot that documents architecture, component interfaces, data flows, and extension points.

## Implementation Plan
- Read `memory-bank/*` core files.
- Scan `src/` for key files and read representative modules.
- Draft `memory-bank/requirements.md` with EARS-style requirements and acceptance mappings.
- Draft `memory-bank/designs/design.md` with architecture diagrams, data models, interfaces, and operational notes.
- Create task record and update tasks index.

## Progress Tracking
**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
