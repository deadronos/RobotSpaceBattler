# Product Context â€” RobotSpaceBattler

**Last updated:** 2025-09-20

## Why this exists

RobotSpaceBattler provides a hands-on sandbox for experimenting with physics-integrated gameplay, procedural asset generation, and modular systems design using modern web tooling.

## Problems it addresses

- Teaching and prototyping how to integrate Rapier physics with a React/Three.js renderer.
- Providing an accessible environment for experimenting with AI and weapon systems without heavy asset pipelines.
- Enabling reproducible tests and CI workflows for interactive simulation logic.

## UX goals

- Fast startup and immediate visual feedback in the browser.
- Minimal controls for spawning, resetting, and toggling debug diagnostics.
- Developer-facing visibility for simulation internals (diagnostics overlay, logs, and test hooks).
